# weather-dashboard

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to build a weather application so that when you type in a city it displayed the current forecast, and the forecast for the next five days. 

- I built this project so people can be prepared to face the oncoming, or current weather when they have to handle their business. 

- This application solves the problem of underdressing, overdressing, or simply just now knowing what the weather has in store for the day, or next five days. 

- I learned that everything can be created dynamically in Javascript, or I can build my skeleton for the application in html, then in javascript just append the data that needs to be rendered into the element I want it to be in.

- The landing page will simply ask you to search a city. 

- After you press search, you will be presented with the current forecast, as well as the forecast for the next five days. 

- The city you searched will be saved in your history right under your search button so incase you wanted to select a city you searched before, you can jusy click on the city in your history and the current forecast, as well as the next five days forecast will pop up.
